# 167 Low Voltage Project plus LED lighting?
#### If your project runs on 1.8v how do you light an LED requiring at least 2.1 volts?

Do you have a low voltage (possibly battery powered) project but you still want to use an LED indicator (or even an LCD that requires both power and backlighting). Where do you begin?

See this video to get a very quick (3 components) method of allowing this. Whilst this is, in effect, a Diode Pump, it's part of a bigger set of circuits that allow voltage doubling and tripling. It sounds counter-intuitive but the laws of physics definitely allow this!
